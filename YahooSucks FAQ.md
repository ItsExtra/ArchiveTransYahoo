## Restricted (private) groups

### Can Restricted groups be made public in the yahoo interface?

No, once this is done it is irreversible. 

### How do I get a Restricted group archived, to be publically available?

You must be aware that this will result in an archive being publically available. We are not able to maintain private status for groups. 

An Archive Team member must be added as a member of your group. This *may not be possible* after October 28 2019, but we are not sure. To be on the safe side, you should try to do this before that date if possible. 

### How do I get an Archive Team member onto my list

See Contact at the top of this page. Get in touch. 

### How do I create my own private archive of a Restricted group?

If you wish to create and keep a private archive for your group, we are able to assist you in doing this , but we can't do the work for you. When clear instructions are available they will be linked here. 

Please see Contact at the top of the page to get in touch with us in the meantime. 

You must be a member of any group you want to archive. You do *not* have to be an admin. 

### Do I need permission of other group members to create an archive?

Technically, no. But depending on the nature of the group, you may want to discuss this. 

## About archiving Groups

### What tools are available

Please see the [wiki page](https://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Yahoo!_Groups). At time of writing nothing is stable and ready to be rolled out, but development is going quickly. 

One candidate is https://github.com/nsapa/yahoo-group-archiver

### Other than emails, what content is there to be preserved?

photos / files / attachments / events / polls / links

### Is there a list of what has already been archived, or what is in the queue?

Not at the moment. 

## About yahoo accounts

You will need a yahoo account to do any archiving. 

If you want to create a new yahoo email address at signup, you will need to provide a mobile phone number for SMS confirmation. It may be possible to use Google Voice numbers for this. 

Using an existing email address bypassess the phone number requirement. 

It is possibel that as archiving gets underway, individual accounts will get banned if Yahoo notices their activity. For this reason we reccomend that you 

- do not use your actual email address
- do not plan on conducting a large amount of scraping with a single account (don't put all your eggs in one basket) 

Here are some places wher eyou can get disposible email addreses:
