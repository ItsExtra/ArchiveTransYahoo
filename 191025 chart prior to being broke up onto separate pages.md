|Support and discussion group for all FTM lower surgeries<br /> (more in source comments)<!-- This group is a safe space for guys of transexperience/ with transition histories to discuss deciding on Lower surgeries. Sometimes guys need a SAFE SPACE to discuss choosing between a centurion, metoidioplasty, phalloplasty, meta then phallo and/or other procedures. When one has decided to pursue a particular surgery then deciding which technique or surgeon often becomes the next point of discussion. This is the place for those discussions to happen.  For guys who have been through this to share their experiences and guys deciding to ask their questions in a RESPECTful way. Discussion about hysterectomies and insurance welcome but must relate back to the main topic of lower surgery otherwise it will be deemed "Off topic".  This community is for you. You will get out of it what you put in. If you ask no questions you will likely get no answers.  We welcome all men of trans experience who have already begun medical transition and SERIOUSLY considering lower surgeries. We also welcome those who have completed lower surgeries. After submitting an application, you will be emailed a brief survey to fill in prior to being approved. We CANNOT approve membership before we receive the survey. If you do not complete the survey within 2 weeks of requesting membership your request will automatically be denied. -->

"All subjects are hard to discuss. Gender is hard to discuss. Orientation is hard to discuss. Faith is hard to discuss. Race is no different. It's hard to discuss. This list happens to be set up specifically to discuss all of these. We are here because we are FTM. That means that gender and orientation go with the territory. We are here because we are ethnic FTM. That means that faith and race discussion goes with the territory...I have faith in us. I respect us  for what we've been through in our lives. I trust us because we are  trustworthy."

Shalom,

Transmelbourne Gender Project is a new network based in Victoria. It's a coalition of people who want to be able to freely embody the gender we feel are. We might be men, women, transgendered, transsexual, intersex, genderqueer, mtf, ftm, queer, or none of the above. We come together not because of what we are, but what we want.

What we want is open to definition, but some of the things might include:
 \* to creatively resist violence against people who don't fit the law that everyone should live the gender assigned to them at birth
 \* to create stronger coalitions between the different people who make up the 'trans' and 'intersex' populations
 \* to respect our differences of background, need, opinion
 \* to be visible in all our diversity
 \* to make spaces where the meaning of gender, politics, identity, desire are not pre-defined
 \* to encourage like-minded people to get involved and add their energy and ideas

We¹re interested in setting up some or all of the following:
 *information and resources for people who need trans-friendly medical help, counselling, support services and welfare
 \* a drop-in centre for resources, a listening ear and support groups
 \* social events
 *political campaigns or actions around issues relevant to gender freedom, for instance changes to birth certificate legislation in Victoria or any gender-related injustice
 \* education campaigns to teach doctors, bureaucrats, employers, teachers, trade unions, politicians, university administrations, dole officers, the next-door neighbours and other people in positions of power how to respect and support the needs of differently gendered folk
 \* a website and publication
 \* film screenings
 \* services targeted to helping particularly vulnerable differently-gendered  folk, especially young people and people without financial security -->

 This group is for straight or straightish non-trans male partners of  FTMs, trans men, FTV/FCDs, and malewards-vectored genderqueer folk. This group is designed to fill a gap in support for the partners of  transfolk and to be comfortable for straight non-trans guys to talk  about how their partners' gender identities and expressions affect them. 

 This group has now been opened to anyone, with moderator approval, who  has a reason for wanting to talk about the issues straight guys face  when their partners transition maleward. Please keep things on topic and supportive. -->

We are a satellite list to FtM-trans, linked below, the safest and oldest FtM peer support lists.

How long can you go without spanking YOUR monkey?  Or not?

A group where f2m's (female to male transsexuals) of all sexual  preferences can share frankly about their sexual/or not experiences.

Talk about how horny you are, if you pump-how often and with what tool, etc.

|We are a peer-run support group for transgender young adults (teen, college-age, twenty-something) in and around Boston.<br /> (more in source comments)<!-- We are a peer-run support group for transgender young adults (teen, college-age, twenty-something) in and around Boston. We are inclusive of both female-to-male (FTM) spectrum and male-to-female (MTF) spectrum individual, of genderqueer persons, of intersexed folks, and of those questioning their gender identity. We are welcoming to people of color and to persons with disabilities. Our meetings are typically a good mix of FTM and MTF members, and of people at varying stages of transition—you really will feel comfortable and included! Come to our group if you are looking for support in understanding your gender identity, help with coming out or transitioning, emotional support, a sense of community, a place where you belong and feel comfortable, or just to meet people you can relate to. The meetings emphasize group participation and mutual respect; a volunteer facilitator and a go-around check-in help to ensure that no one member dictates the flow and everyone has a chance to express themselves. Discussions at the meeting are confidential between members, and members agree not to assume that others go by the same name/pronouns/identity outside the group. We are aware that groups advertising trans “community” can be rife with the same prejudices we are trying to get away from, and our members do strive to be aware and to keep the meetings free of judgments and full of acceptance.<br />We do ask that you respect the stated age range when asking to join as this group was founded in response to other pre-existing support groups that were not relevant to our experiences.<br />Meetings will be held near Harvard Square in Cambridge. Specific details about our location and schedule will be given upon becoming a member. The meeting space is disability accessible.<br />Note: Joining the online group effectively allows you to receive emails from our mailing list. -->
