Subject: 

Do you want to save the contents of trans group from deletion?

Hello,

I have joined this group because it has recently been announced that all yahoo groups will be deleted December 14, 2019. 

I would like owners and members to consider the possibility of downloading and archiving the contents of the group. For groups with open join policies (like this one), I will await discussion on the list before doing anything. If this list is no longer active and no discussion happens, I will likely archive the group, though that may change as I learn more about this subject. 

Here is a site put together quickly with further information: https://archivetransyahoo.noblogs.org

About me: I am a gay trans man on T x 10ish years. I'm just a nerd who thinks are histories are important. I have no relevant organizational or institutional affiliations. I have no personal interest in this data; I am not an academic or other kind of researcher. I simply do not want it to be lost forever. 

Please feel free to email me at this address <ArchiveTransY@protonmail.com>. Please feel free to share any of this information with anyone you know who may be interested. 

Thank you for your time in reviewing this.

Jack

One thing to be completely clear about: **there is no obligation to share any materials** outside of your group. I will assist anyone who requires it to retrieve their data in whatever way they need. Even if you don't need assistance but will be doing this in-house, I am hoping to compile a list of such archives and where they can be found for future use. 

Please feel free to email me at this address [ArchiveTransY@protonmail.com](mailto:ArchiveTransY@protonmail.com). Please feel free to share any of this information with anyone you know who may be interested.
