Hi,

I have requested to join because it has recently been announced that all yahoo groups will be deleted December 14, 2019. 

I would like owners and members to consider the possibility of downloading and archiving the contents of the group. 

Here is a site put together quickly with further information: https://archivetransyahoo.noblogs.org

There is a possibility that after October 28, 2019, it will no longer be possible to add new members to the group. (See link above.) So if this is possibly of interest to you, you may want to ap[prove this membership request before that time. I promise not to download anything without permission!! 

About me: I am a gay trans man on T x 10ish years. I'm just a nerd who thinks are histories are important. I have no relevant organizational or institutional affiliations. I have no personal interest in this data; I am not an academic or other kind of researcher. I simply so not want it to be lost forever. 

Please feel free to email me at this address <ArchiveTransY@protonmail.com>. Please feel free to share any of this information with any you know who may be interested. 

Thank you for your time in reviewing this.

Jack
