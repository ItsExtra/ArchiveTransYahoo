If you are FTM, you are invited to be  a member of FTM Surgery Info as well. For more information, go here \n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" HREF=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ftmsurgeryinfo\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ftmsurgeryinfo</a>\n\n<p>FTM Surgery Support offers open discussion of emotional, physical, psychological and financial issues facing FtM (Female to Male) transgendered / transsexual / transman / ftm / masculine identified / questioning individuals who are considering, undergoing, or have completed any FTM surgery, including Phalloplasty, Metoidioplasty (Metaoidioplasty, Meta), Clitoral Release, Centurion, Chest Surgery (Peri- Aureolar, Double Incision Mastectomy), Hysterectomy, Oophectomy, etc. \n\n<p>This is a SURGERY discussion group. As such, the topics discussed in this group dwell solely on SURGERY. FTM Surgery Support is focused on the costs of surgery, insurance, financing, travel and lodging accommodations for those who may want to travel out of state/country. These topics will allow members to exchange help with assistance and what to do in regards to preparation for surgery. This group may discuss emotional impact of surgeries, and also has more in-depth post surgical anecdotal discussions than can be held on FTM Surgery Info, which is more for information gathering.  Posts are moderated (held for moderator approval) to ensure that the group stays on topic.\n\n<p>As this is a group that focuses on discussions surrounding surgery issues, non-surgery topics are being referred to other more general open discussion groups.  Please do a group search for &quot;FTM&quot; groups to search for groups that will discuss topics such as therapy, hormones, general medical care, legal issues, politics, binary/fluid gender topics, social/familial/employment ramifications of transition or any other transitioning topic other than SURGERY.</div>","website":"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ftmsurgeryinfo","categoryId":1600083764,"dateCreated":1048168004,"name":"ftmsurgerysupport","membersVis":"MODERATORS","groupVis":"ALL","messagesVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","filesVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","linksVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","calendarVis":"MODERATORS","databaseVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","pollsVis":"MODERATORS","postsVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","photosVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","messageAttachments":"ATTACHMENTS_DISABLED","messageModeration":"ALL_USERS_MODERATED","messagePost":"SUBSCRIBERS","memberShipType":"RESTRICTED","replyTo":"LIST_AND_SENDER","unListed":false,"emailHidden":false,"photoModeration":false,"emailSubject":"[ftmsurgerysupport]","spamFiltering":false,"entityId":"@@groups_1128b16f-25a4-4773-8940-f471c8072529","intlCode":"us","langCode":"en-US","adult":true,"calView":3,"categoryName":"Adult","categoryPath":"/Romance & Relationships/Adult/","isPhotomaticEnabled":true,"isPhotomaticEligible":false,"isPostAllowForNonMembers":false,"bucketId":"GB0"}}
