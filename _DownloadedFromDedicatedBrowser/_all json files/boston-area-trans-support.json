We are inclusive of both female-to-male (FTM) spectrum and male-to-female (MTF) spectrum individual, of genderqueer persons, of intersexed folks, and of those questioning their gender identity. We are welcoming to people of color and to persons with disabilities. Our meetings are typically a good mix of FTM and MTF members, and of people at varying stages of transition—you really will feel comfortable and included! Come to our group if you are looking for support in understanding your gender identity, help with coming out or transitioning, emotional support, a sense of community, a place where you belong and feel comfortable, or just to meet people you can relate to. The meetings emphasize group participation and mutual respect; a volunteer facilitator and a go-around check-in help to ensure that no one member dictates the flow and everyone has a chance to express themselves. Discussions at the meeting are confidential between members, and members agree not to assume that others go by the same name/pronouns/identity outside the group. We are aware that groups advertising trans “community” can be rife with the same prejudices we are trying to get away from, and our members do strive to be aware and to keep the meetings free of judgments and full of acceptance.\n\nWe do ask that you respect the stated age range when asking to join as this group was founded in response to other pre-existing support groups that were not relevant to our experiences.\n\nMeetings will be held near Harvard Square in Cambridge. Specific details about our location and schedule will be given upon becoming a member. The meeting space is disability accessible.\n\nNote: Joining the online group effectively allows you to receive emails from our mailing list.</div>","categoryId":1600015468,"dateCreated":1142982172,"name":"boston-area-trans-support","membersVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","groupVis":"ALL","messagesVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","filesVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","linksVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","calendarVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","databaseVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","pollsVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","postsVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","photosVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","messageAttachments":"STORE_ON_SITE_AND_SEND_LINK_IN_EMAIL","messageModeration":"UNMODERATED","messagePost":"SUBSCRIBERS","memberShipType":"RESTRICTED","replyTo":"LIST","unListed":false,"emailHidden":true,"photoModeration":false,"emailSubject":"[boston-area-trans-support]","spamFiltering":true,"entityId":"@@groups_ae7cc369-7d35-4bd8-8d56-9ab50600cfe1","intlCode":"us","langCode":"en-US","adult":false,"pictureUrl":"https://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/8KCKaibtfdUbzSTSBQ--/homepage/name/681918.jpg","calView":3,"categoryName":"Transgendered","categoryPath":"/Cultures & Community/Groups/Transgendered/","isPhotomaticEnabled":true,"isPhotomaticEligible":true,"isPostAllowForNonMembers":false,"bucketId":"GB0"}}
