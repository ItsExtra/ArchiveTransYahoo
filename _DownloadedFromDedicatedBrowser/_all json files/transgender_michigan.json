It is intended to be a forum for transgender people and their significant others, family, friends, and allies to chat with one another and find support on the issues that are important to them.  Personal ads that are romantic or sexual in nature will not be tolerated.  There are many Yahoo Groups that are devoted to finding partners within the transgender community, and we suggest that those of you intending to use the TransGender_Michigan Yahoo Group in this way try to find one of these groups.  <br>\n<br>Because this is intended to be a friendly and supportive environment, TransGender Michigan reserves the right to edit, delete, or moderate any posting, file, photo, link, picture, poll, calendar item, or chat discussion, that exhibits inflammatory or sexually explicit content.
