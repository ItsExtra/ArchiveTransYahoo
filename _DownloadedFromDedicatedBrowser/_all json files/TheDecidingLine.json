Sometimes guys need a SAFE SPACE to discuss choosing between a centurion, metoidioplasty, phalloplasty, meta then phallo and/or other procedures. When one has decided to pursue a particular surgery then deciding which technique or surgeon often becomes the next point of discussion. This is the place for those discussions to happen. \n\nFor guys who have been through this to share their experiences and guys deciding to ask their questions in a RESPECTful way. Discussion about hysterectomies and insurance welcome but must relate back to the main topic of lower surgery otherwise it will be deemed &quot;Off topic&quot;.\n\nThis community is for you. You will get out of it what you put in. If you ask no questions you will likely get no answers.\n\nWe welcome all men of trans experience who have already begun medical transition and SERIOUSLY considering lower surgeries. We also welcome those who have completed lower surgeries. After submitting an application, you will be emailed a brief survey to fill in prior to being approved. We CANNOT approve membership before we receive the survey. If you do not complete the survey within 2 weeks of requesting membership your request will automatically be denied.</div>","categoryId":1600083764,"dateCreated":1271523124,"name":"TheDecidingLine","membersVis":"MODERATORS","groupVis":"ALL","messagesVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","filesVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","linksVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","calendarVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","databaseVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","pollsVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","postsVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","photosVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","messageAttachments":"STORE_ON_SITE_AND_SEND_LINK_IN_EMAIL","messageModeration":"UNMODERATED","messagePost":"SUBSCRIBERS","memberShipType":"RESTRICTED","replyTo":"LIST_AND_SENDER","unListed":true,"emailHidden":false,"photoModeration":false,"emailSubject":"[TheDecidingLine]","spamFiltering":true,"entityId":"@@groups_e247d2fd-97b9-4363-abe4-fb74eef5d179","intlCode":"us","langCode":"en-US","adult":true,"pictureUrl":"https://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/q8s6_sToc9CAoXJYCQ--/homepage/name/38313.jpg","calView":3,"categoryName":"Adult","categoryPath":"/Romance & Relationships/Adult/","isPhotomaticEnabled":true,"isPhotomaticEligible":false,"isPostAllowForNonMembers":false,"bucketId":"GB0"}}
