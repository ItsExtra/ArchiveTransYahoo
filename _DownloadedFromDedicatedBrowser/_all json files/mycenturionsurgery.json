Groups.\n\nI have created this group for other FTMs like myself to learn about the Centurion enhanced meta procedure performed by Dr. Peter Raphael in Plano, TX. I feel that there is not enough information available and the procedure remains mysterious to guys making choices for their surgical futures. I originally had my Centurion in 2003. My wish is not to recommend or persuade anyone to consider this procedure, simply to provide my experiences.\n\nI will take questions via email and then post answers as I am able to. PLEASE SEE THE FAQ FILE IN THE &quot;FILES&quot; SECTION FOR INFORMATION AND QUESTIONS I HAVE ALREADY ANSWERED.\n\nI am not by any means an expert or official representative of this procedure.  Dr. Raphael has given personal permission for this group and I am able to contact him directly for additional information if the need arises. The American Institute for Plastic Surgery is not responsible for any content posted here.\n\nIf anyone else who has had the Centurion would like to post their results and first-hand accounts here anonymously please contact me. I am hoping that eventually this group may be a compilation of results with detailed personal accounts. I do not have a lot of knowledge of other people&#39;s experience with this procedure so I too am learning. \n\nFor additional information about the Centurion you may contact a patient consultant at Dr. Raphael&#39;s office at (972) 543-2477. \n\nMEMBERS, PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL, THIS IS MEANT TO BE EDUCATIONAL AND A SERVICE TO THE FTM COMMUNITY, TIME SPENT ON THIS PROJECT IS MY OWN AND I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REMOVE CONTENT FOR ANY REASON. IMAGES ARE NOT TO BE DUPLICATED OR PUBLISHED ANYWHERE ELSE.\n\nThere is also a folder in the photo section where anyone can post anything related to FTMs. \n\nHope you can learn something!</div>","categoryId":1600083764,"dateCreated":1201918374,"name":"mycenturionsurgery","membersVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","groupVis":"ALL","messagesVis":"ALL","filesVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","linksVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","calendarVis":"NOBODY","databaseVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","pollsVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","postsVis":"ALL","photosVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","messageAttachments":"STORE_ON_SITE_AND_SEND_LINK_IN_EMAIL","messageModeration":"UNMODERATED","messagePost":"SUBSCRIBERS","memberShipType":"RESTRICTED","replyTo":"LIST","unListed":false,"emailHidden":false,"photoModeration":false,"emailSubject":"[mycenturionsurgery]","spamFiltering":true,"intlCode":"us","langCode":"en-US","adult":true,"pictureUrl":"https://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/ZAKrvTvue9dPDixjpA--/homepage/name/745802.jpg","calView":3,"categoryName":"Adult","categoryPath":"/Romance & Relationships/Adult/","isPhotomaticEnabled":true,"isPhotomaticEligible":false,"isPostAllowForNonMembers":false,"bucketId":"GB0"}}
