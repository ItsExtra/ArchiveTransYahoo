Check out our website for more information: http://www.ftmsc.org. \n\nMembership includes those who are questioning, examining, or exploring their masculine gender identity, those who are in various stages of transitioning or who have already transitioned with or without medical treatments, and significant others/partners/spouses and friends, family members and allies. \n\nSome of us are straight, gay, or bisexual. We come from all walks of life, economic backgrounds, educational experiences, career paths, political leanings, etc. Rather than focus on our differences, we focus on our common experiences to find ways to support each other.</div>","website":"http://www.ftmsc.org","categoryId":1600015468,"dateCreated":1073117743,"name":"ftmsonomacounty","membersVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","groupVis":"ALL","messagesVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","filesVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","linksVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","calendarVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","databaseVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","pollsVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","postsVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","photosVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","messageAttachments":"STORE_ON_SITE_AND_SEND_LINK_IN_EMAIL","messageModeration":"ALL_USERS_MODERATED","messagePost":"SUBSCRIBERS","memberShipType":"RESTRICTED","replyTo":"LIST","unListed":false,"emailHidden":false,"photoModeration":false,"emailSubject":"[ftmsonomacounty]","spamFiltering":true,"entityId":"@@groups_fe9d8d11-5a38-421a-8cd8-9b93c6ae1b02","intlCode":"us","langCode":"en-US","adult":false,"pictureUrl":"https://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/A1qT3B3te9ZtZ7fvkg--/homepage/name/394676.jpg","calView":3,"categoryName":"Transgendered","categoryPath":"/Cultures & Community/Groups/Transgendered/","isPhotomaticEnabled":true,"isPhotomaticEligible":true,"isPostAllowForNonMembers":false,"bucketId":"GB0"}}
