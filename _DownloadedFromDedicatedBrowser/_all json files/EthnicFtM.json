This would include, but not be limited to, Black/African American or Afro-Carribean (African diaspora), Hispanic/Latino, members of the Jewish diaspora, Muslim/Moslem, Asian, AmIndian/Native American/First Nation, Mestizo, Pacific Islander, French-Canadian or any other ethnic identity that does not fit well into the mainstream of available FtM discussion groups. <br><br>EthnicFtM offers a space where members are free to discuss general FtM concerns, as well as all concerns specific to the Ethnic and Religious minorities that we belong to. Respectful SOFFAs, friends and health care providers are welcome. <br><br>\n&quot;It&#39;s not just Negroes but all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry.&quot; ~Lyndon Baines Johnson, 1964, in a speech he did not regret but that ultimately cost him the support of Southern Democrats<br><br>\n\nEthnicFtM is part of the FtM-trans Network of lists, which has provided FtM peer support and information in a safe environment since 1999. \n<br>\n<br>\nEthnicFtM@yahoogroups is moderated by Rabbi Levi A, President of FTMI.<br><br>Contact Levi at EthnicFtM-owner@yahoogroups.com\n   <br>\n<br>\n&quot;All subjects are hard to discuss. Gender is hard to discuss.\nOrientation is hard to discuss. Faith is hard to discuss. Race is no\ndifferent. It&#39;s hard to discuss. This list happens to be set up\nspecifically to discuss all of these. We are here because we are FTM.\nThat means that gender and orientation go with the territory. We are\nhere because we are ethnic FTM. That means that faith and race\ndiscussion goes with the territory...I have faith in us. I respect us for what we&#39;ve been through in our lives. I trust us because we are trustworthy.&quot;\n<br>\n<br>\nShalom,\nLevi</div>","website":"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/FtM-trans/","categoryId":1600015468,"dateCreated":1051356904,"name":"EthnicFtM","membersVis":"MODERATORS","groupVis":"ALL","messagesVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","filesVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","linksVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","calendarVis":"LIMITED","databaseVis":"MODERATORS","pollsVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","postsVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","photosVis":"SUBSCRIBERS","messageAttachments":"STORE_ON_SITE_AND_SEND_LINK_IN_EMAIL","messageModeration":"ALL_USERS_MODERATED","messagePost":"SUBSCRIBERS","memberShipType":"RESTRICTED","replyTo":"LIST","unListed":false,"emailHidden":false,"photoModeration":true,"emailSubject":"[EthnicFtM]","spamFiltering":true,"entityId":"@@groups_4bd5a1fe-11ce-4d31-b706-97a63fe0886b","intlCode":"us","langCode":"en-US","adult":false,"pictureUrl":"https://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/WQO44Hblc9iOj3wg/homepage/name/877145.jpg","calView":3,"categoryName":"Transgendered","categoryPath":"/Cultures & Community/Groups/Transgendered/","isPhotomaticEnabled":true,"isPhotomaticEligible":true,"isPostAllowForNonMembers":false,"bucketId":"GB0"}}
