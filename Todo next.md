### What's here

This wiki is for in progress documents which contain no confidential/private information. Public facing materials on on the [wordpress site](https://archivetransyahoo.noblogs.org/). 

- Originally there was just the 

  Chart of all known trans Yahoo! Groups

  , but the document became so large that it was unwieldy. That page will be updated periodically as is useful, but below are the documents actually being used.

  - [Chart: Working](https://archivetransyahoo.miraheze.org/wiki/Chart: Working)
  - [Chart: Joined/Approved, but no clear direction re archiving](https://archivetransyahoo.miraheze.org/wiki/Chart: Joined/Approved, but no clear direction re archiving)
